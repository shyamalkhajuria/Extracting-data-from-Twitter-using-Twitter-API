# Extracting-data-from-Twitter-using-Twitter-API
The following repository includes code for Extracting data from Twitter using Twitter API
Please install tweepy package first. 
Make sure you have a twitter developer account. Create a separate .c file containing the Twitter API key and secret code (Confidential).
I have also attached the excel file for reference that contains data of tweets that contain the word "Olympics" and have limited it to 50 tweets using the command -c 50
